# Onshape Intro
* When you first log in, you are on the Documents Page, where you manage all your documents. 
![xx](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/java-rnrr/CAD/gh-pages/images/onshape_doc.png)
  * To open a document, left click on the document name or double-click anywhere in the highlighted area
    * To return to the document page, click on the "Onshape" logo in the upper left hand corner
  * What is a document?
    * A document is NOT a CAD file
    * A document can contain anything related to one or more projects, such as assemblies, sub-assemblies, parts, drawings, imported parts, or any other project-related data, such as PDF's, images, and videos
    * Documents keep all your data together in one place in order to make your project easier to manage
  * On the left hand side of the Document page is the Documents filter 
    * When the **"My Onshape"** filter is active, every document that you have access to is listed and divided into three sections.
      * Documents **"Last opened by me"**, makes it easy to find and open documents so you can continue your work.
        * To open a document, just left-click on the name or double-click the thumbnail image
      * **Folders** is a method that can be used to manage documents
      * All other documents, not in a Folder, will be in the **Documents** section with the most-recently-modified document at the top.  This lists all the documents that you have access to.  
    * FILTERS
      * If you want to filter just those that you created, then you can filter using the **Created by me** filter.
      * If you want to filter documents that are **Shared with me**, then click on that filter in the left panel
      * If you want to filter on recently opened documents, click on that filter in the left panel
    * The columns of the documents include the following:
      * thumbnail image
      * name of the document (with an optional label underneath) and last opened workspace
      * etc.
    * Clicking on the document, opens up a **Details** panel on the right.
  * To create a new document, click on the **Create** pull-down menu and select **Document**
